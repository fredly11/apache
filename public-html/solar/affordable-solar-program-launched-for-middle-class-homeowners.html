Due to the steep upfront costs of around $32,000 in cash, only those upper-income families can afford to install solar arrays. Home Professionals is, however, looking to change that. This new project hopes to help middle class communities see the sun in a different light.</strong><br></div>
      <p class="paragraph-6">Using money raised by  government incentives and private investors to help fight global warming, Home Professionals goal is to get solar panels on the roofs of those who cannot afford them.

The homeowner gets solar panels on their roof and a new reduced electric bill. If interested you can sign up by filling out the form below. Home Professionals predicts that it could save individual families up to $3,600 a year off their electric bill, which they hope could then be spent on other essential bills.<br><br>Home Professionals is excited to be promoting one of the first dedicated solar repayment systems for middle class families allowing them to get a low solar bill and an even lower electric bill. The goal is to install solar arrays to over 25,838 homes by the end of next year. By using training programs, government incentives, money from companies and private investors, they aim to keep the costs to those who provide and install the panels as low as possible.<br><br>In recent days there has been talk about how more can be contributed through raising money and providing more rebates. In the attempt to curb greenhouse gas emissions, and move toward installing solar arrays. In total, the solar program has totted up to an impressive movement.<br><br>By ploughing at least 26% of the money from government incentives and using private investors to back the solar installation, the project aims to kill two birds with one stone – saving Middle-Class families money, while also making big fossil fuel polluting companies help to cut energy emissions in the state even further.<br><br>Anyone who is a homeowner in a single family neighborhood that is classed as middle-class is qualified to apply to get the arrays installed.
