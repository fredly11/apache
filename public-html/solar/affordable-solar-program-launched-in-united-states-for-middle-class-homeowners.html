      <div class="text-block-4">{{state?The United States}} is one of the best states in the country if you want to go solar – but only if you’re rich enough. Due to the steep upfront costs of around $32,000 in cash, only those upper-income families can afford to install solar arrays. Home Professionals is, however, looking to change that. This new project hopes to help middle class communities see the sun in a different light.<br></div>
      <p class="paragraph-6">Using money raised by  government incentives and private investors to help fight global warming, Home Professionals goal is to get solar panels on the roofs of those who cannot afford them. According to recent news, the plan is to use the rebates set aside for solar and the money raised by companies who want to lower the per ton of carbon dioxide emitted.<br><br>The cost for the installation to the middle class families: nothing. The homeowner gets solar panels on their roof and a new reduced electric rate. If interested you can sign up at by filling out the form below. Home Professionals predicts that it could save individual families up to $2,400 a year, which they hope could then be spent on other essential bills.<br><br>Home Professionals is excited to be promoting one of the first dedicated solar repayment systems for middle class families allowing them to get a low solar bill and an even lower electric bill. The goal is to install solar arrays to over 3,200 homes by the end of next year. By using training programs, government incentives, money from companies and private investors, they aim to keep the costs to those who provide and install the panels as low as possible.<br><br>The state government in recent days has talked about how they can contribute through raising money to be able to provide more rebates. In the attempt to curb greenhouse gas emissions, and move toward installing solar arrays. In total, the solar program has totted up to an impressive movement.<br><br>By ploughing at least 26% of the money from government incentives and using private investors to back the solar installation, the project aims to kill two birds with one stone – saving Middle-Class families money, while also making big fossil fuel polluting companies help to cut energy emissions in the state even further.<br><br>Anyone who is currently living in a neighborhood in the state that is classed as middle-class is qualified to apply to get the arrays installed. The sun sets on the initiative as the year ends in 2020, so if you’re living in the state, you might want to jump on board soon.Home Professionals invites everyone to find out if they qualify by signing up for a free visit. To increase the ease of finding out if you’re in the middle-class and qualified they specifically created the form below. They hope that the funding put towards this initiative will be well spent, if they can get interested homeowners reaching out to them, they estimate that they’ll be able hit their goal of 3,200 homes by the end of the year 2020.<br><br><br>‍<strong>Update:<br>We’ve been notified that panels are still available for homes, you can see if you qualify for the program by filling out the form below.</strong></p>
